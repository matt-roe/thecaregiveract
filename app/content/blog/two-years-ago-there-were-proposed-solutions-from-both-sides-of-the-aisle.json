  "content": "Dear Senator or Representative,\n\n\nHealthcare is in crisis. We all know it and it’s getting worse every day. We are way past\nstopgap measures like the National Guard troops, federal healthcare workers, Mercy ships\nand field hospitals. We cannot staff the hospital beds we have and downstream services\nlike Nursing homes and home care are far worse off.\n\n\nThe solution is to bring back millions of healthcare workers who have chosen to leave their\nprofession. Why would any of our largest group of workers, the caregivers, nursing\nAssistants and homecare workers, return for low wages, dangerous jobs, long hours and\nno hope a solution is on the way?\n\n\nTwo years ago, there were proposed solutions from both sides of the aisle. House Bill 6484\nin April 2020 and Sen. Romney’s Patriot Pay proposal ($12 per hours wage add on) made\nsense. Today we are in far worse shape and we urge you to combine aspects of those two\nideas today.\n\n\nAmericans need your help NOW, we need our leaders to move us away from Crisis Levels of\nCare and believe good care can and will unite us.\n\n\nAct now by supporting an emergency Executive Order or, even better, pass a bipartisan\nCaregiver Act.\n\n\nWe at NAHCA and The Caregiver Project stand ready with research, data and details of a\nproposed Caregiver Act\n\nThe Caregiver Act Board of Directors\nJames Roe, Founder\nConnie Anderson, VP\nJan Kline, Secretary",
