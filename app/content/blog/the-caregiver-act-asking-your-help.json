  "content": "We have a dream.  The Caregiver Act non profit proposes at $12 per hour over prevailing wages pay for nursing aides, assistants, and home care workers.\n\nJim Roe, former owner of nursing homes, was featured years ago in a PBS broadcast call Brave New World.  He was president of the Wa State Healthcare Assoc.  He has done diligent research on what would be budget positive in all 435 congressional districts in the U S A.\n\nWe need help getting our word out.  We have an idea that we believe could unify our country around caring for our elders and most vulnerable while honoring those compassionate individuals (90% women, majority of color) who are the front line, hand holding caregivers we need now.  Additionally, we will need 8 million more by 2028 as the population turns 65 at the rate of 10,000 per day.\n\n\n\nThis is a cause that is right, just, kind, and necessary.  We would be deeply thankful for any help or interview you might be able to arrange.\n\n\n\nJan Kline\n\nThe Caregiver Act"
